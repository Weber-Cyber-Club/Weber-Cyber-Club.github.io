Welcome to the Weber State Cybersecurity Club! This is a student-run organization within Weber State University, with the primary goal of teaching students more about cybersecurity, both on the practical and ethical side. Within the club, we hope to give students a community where they can share ideas, projects, employment opportunities, class help, and most importantly, meet other students who have the same interests and goals that they do. 

## What Do We Do?
The Weber State Cyber Club strives to be involved in many different facets of cybersecurity. In the past, the club has participated in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges; however, we also write our own challenges, giving students the ability to both teach and learn from one another. The club also posts information about upcoming cyber events/conferences in our area, most of which are free for students to attend, in the hopes of giving students connections outside of our own school. Finally, we try to meet at least one a month, in these meetings we provide cyber trainings, as well as an opportunity to discuss things we have seen in the cyber world, or just talk about things we are involved in through school.

## How Can I Join?
To join the cyber club you can register on Weber State's Clubs & Organizations page, which can be found [here](https://weberorgs.dserec.com/online/clubsports/). We also ask that you join and sign into our club's [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/33mxfQCBgz), as this will give you the chance to speak with all of our club members and get up-to-date information on what is going on within our club.
